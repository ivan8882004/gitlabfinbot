Summary for risk_assessment_analysis.txt:
QUALCOMM faces significant risks primarily from customer concentration, as a large portion of its revenue relies on a few key customers that may switch to in-house or competitor products, impacting sales stability. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, pose threats to operations and supply chains, possibly limiting transactions with critical customers. Additionally, the company's reliance on third-party suppliers for semiconductor manufacturing subjects it to vulnerabilities related to supply disruptions, which can hinder production and negatively affect overall financial performance.
