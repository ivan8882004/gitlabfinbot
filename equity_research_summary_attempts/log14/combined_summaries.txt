Summary for risk_assessment_analysis.txt:
QUALCOMM faces significant risks, including:

1. Customer Dependence: A large portion of revenue stems from a few customers, which increases vulnerability to fluctuations in demand and customer vertical integration into their own integrated circuits, potentially impacting revenues.

2. Geopolitical and Trade Tensions: U.S.-China relations pose risks, as political actions may limit transaction capabilities, particularly with Chinese OEMs, resulting in reduced revenue opportunities.

3. Competitive Pressures: Intense competition in the semiconductor market and rapid technological changes may lead to price erosion, impacting margins and market share.
